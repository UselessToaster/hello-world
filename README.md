# hello-world
My first repository

Hey everyone! My name is Tianna and I am most interested in learning more about machine learning and AI.
But I am also open to learning about areas of programming as well.
So far, I've dabbled in C# and java.script, 
and I am  currently learning python more in depth on LinkedIn Learning.
I will also be taking a programming concepts class in the spring that centers around Java.
In my free time I love caring for my plants and long bike rides exploring the city :)
